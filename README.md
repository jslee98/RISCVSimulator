# RISCVSimulator

This was a solo project for CSCI 320 - Computer Architecture at Bucknell. We simulated a 1-stage RISC-V Sodor processor in Verilog with support for 20+ instructions including ALU operations, memory load and stores, branching and jumps. The program is read from the mem.hex file, translated into binary, decoded, and executed.
